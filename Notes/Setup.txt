Angular 2 setup 

Angular CLI 

https://github.com/angular/angular-cli


npm install -g angular-cli

Then to create a folder to work from 

ng new FOLDERNAME   

then serve it up 

ng serve     which is  localhost:4200   

-----

however the quickstart of google uses the npm install / npm start  
in which liteserver with browserlink is really nice
