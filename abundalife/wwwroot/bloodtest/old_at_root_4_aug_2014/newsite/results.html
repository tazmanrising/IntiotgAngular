                    Personal  Report of Findings</strong></span></span><br />
              </div>
                <p align="justify" class="style22">The  following information is based on a combination of laboratory diagnostics,  medical history of past and present symptoms and the 200-year-old science of iridology,  cross correlated and made possible with 21st century computer  technology.<br />
                    <br />
                  Abunda  Life's form of naturopathic medicine is based on a 3500 year old, time tested and proven  philosophy and belief system.  Because we  believe that every symptom is a sign of a nutritional deficiency and every  named medical condition is a sign of a long-term deficiency ignored or worse  suppressed with a drug, we do not treat or diagnose any specific disease or named Medical Condition.  We focus rather on the nutritional causation  of your personal condition.<br />
  <br />
                  Our philosophy looks to  uncover what we believe is the common denominator of almost every named medical  condition, namely toxicity, nutritional deficiency, hormonal imbalance, stress  and spiritual life incongruity and imbalces of Body, Mind and Spirit.  Each  person's needs are different, even if their medical doctor's diagnosis is  exactly the same.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="style22">This report of finding is  prepared for educational purposes for the patient/student and informational  purpose for the patient's busy primary care physician.  This report is not a diagnosis, prescription  or treatment for any named medical condition.   Our opinion may not conform to those of the American Medical Association  or your primary care physician and may even be contrary to the views held by  the orthodox drug medical profession.<br />
                    <br />
                  Our form of naturopathic  medicine is understandingly not for everyone.   It is designed for intelligent, proactive, health minded people seeking  to optimize their nutrition and God given potential for high  level wellness.  We believe our system of  medicine makes the most sense for thinking men and women not willing to wait  for degenerate disease to gain a foothold or leave their future health to  chance.<br />
  <br />
                  Abunda Life's system  represents an advanced form of preventative and anti-aging medicine by  incorporating the Abunda Life Body, Mind and Spirit natural healing philosophy  into a practical, sensible, healthful and successful way of life.<br />
  <br />
                  Abunda Life's system of  naturopathic medicine is first a philosophy.   This philosophy motivates our discipline that then becomes our new way  of life and finally that wonderful way of life becomes the greatest medicine in  the world.  A true preventative medicine  that in reality is high level wellness of body, mind and spirit, a new breed of Medicine.<br />
  <br />
                  Our goal at Abunda Life, at  some point, is to become substance free.   Free of all harmful substances including unnecessary medications and  devitalized food.  The naturopathic  doctor's 1001 is a computerized analysis that is highly specific and  scientifically based.  It is programmed  to address your personalized needs.  The  system uses sophisticated technology to develop an accurate individual program  based on your individual bio-chemistry.<br />
  <br />
                  The 1001 enables a proper  and precise sequencing of your lifestyle changes, naturopathic detoxification,  compatible/non-compatible foods, dietary nutritional saturation therapy,  bio-identical hormone restoration, I.V. vitamin/chelation therapy, oxidative  therapies, bodyfat loss, fitness medicine, stress relief and other appropriate  clinical and home self help therapies that may be indicated based on your test  results.<br />
  <br />
                  This approach uses over 200  different metabolic classifications to analyze the bottom line cause of your  condition and to monitor, advise and   coach you to higher levels of wellness using 100% natural  therapies.  Unlike main stream medicine  that waits for a full blown named disease to set in before rendering its  diagnosis and treatment plan, the 1001 program is designed to catch disease in  the earliest state possible, which is the deficiency stage.  The 1001 testing makes this possible by  employing a much higher criterion in its evaluating process.<br />
  <br />
                  In our form of medicine we  don't want the diagnosis.  Our job is to  help you first of all prevent the diagnosis and then begin to build an  indestructible immune system and to begin to push back the pre-mature aging process  and its related degenerative diseases.<br />
  <br />
                  Unlike orthodox drug  medicine, we will always find something you can improve on.  You will never hear us utter the words, Your  problem is all in your head€ or You're perfectly healthy when you are  experiencing symptoms.  Most of the time  we will be able to connect your symptoms to a deficiency and make a definitive  recommendation of a natural remedy.<br />
  <br />
                  Your test results are keyed  against what your lab test scores should be if everything was working  perfectly.  Because it takes years and even decades for full blown degenerative disease to set in, we do not wait for a shocking  diagnosis to begin working on your nutrition.   We allow your body's highest authority to determine what is best for you  taking all the guess work out of your nutritional needs.<br />
  <br />
                  Your Naturopathic Doctor's 1001 Report of Findings  indicates that the following metabolic and nutritional conditions are out of  balance and need to be addressed naturopathically and nutritionally:<br />
