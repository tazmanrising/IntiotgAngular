Angular 2 setup 

Angular CLI 

https://github.com/angular/angular-cli


npm install -g angular-cli

Then to create a folder to work from 

ng new FOLDERNAME   

then serve it up 

ng serve     which is  localhost:4200   

Various problems:
1.  You have to be inside an angular-cli project in order to use the serve command. 
      solution :    cd folder
2. node_modules appears empty, you may need to run `npm install` 
    ....

3.  major errors  fix with npm install ...

Errors then 

seems like you haven't yet installed dependencies in package.json or failed installattion . Just remove node_modules folder, clean cache

npm cache clean

and install project packages

npm install


npm start

-----

however the quickstart of google uses the npm install / npm start  
in which liteserver with browserlink is really nice

Got Setup Issues (with Angular 2 CLI)?
Section 1, Lecture 4
In this course I'll use the CLI. I recommend using it as it makes the creation and management of Angular 2 projects very easy.

The CLI still is in beta and therefore it works for most students but some also experience issues. If you got some issues try these steps (use sudo  on Mac and Linux):

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm cache clean
[sudo] npm install -g angular-cli@latest 
(notice the @latest addition - this might fix your installation issues).

To get fast support with any remainding errors,  make sure to browse Q&A section on the installation video - or google any "angular cli YOUR ERROR MESSAGE" => Chances are high to find a solution to your issue!

But if you still got problems installing it (it still is in beta after all) or want to try out/ use a different setup, you may have a look at the following seed project: https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed

Follow the instructions on this page to set it up and use it. The folder structure follows a similar approach as the CLI - you're going to work in the src/client/app  folder (CLI: src/app ).

Be aware that you won't be able to use the ng commands (like ng generate component ) but as I show and discuss all the files generated by the CLI, that shouldn't be an issue. You'll have to create such files on your own, but you will be able to do so.

If you're using this seed because the CLI doesn't work, you may occasionally check for updates of the CLI (explained in section 16 of this course).
