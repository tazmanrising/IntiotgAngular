Angular 2 setup 

Angular CLI 

https://github.com/angular/angular-cli


npm install -g angular-cli

Then to create a folder to work from 

ng new FOLDERNAME   

then serve it up 

ng serve     which is  localhost:4200   

Errors then 

seems like you haven't yet installed dependencies in package.json or failed installattion . Just remove node_modules folder, clean cache

npm cache clean

and install project packages

npm install


npm start

however the quickstart of google uses the npm install / npm start  
in which liteserver with browserlink is really nice
