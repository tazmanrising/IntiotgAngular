An important note regarding API usage

In the following lectures we use the free openweathermap API to get weather data. Since the recording of the lectures, openweathermap has now required a free sign up to use their data. You then receive a key that you include in the URL when you request data.

The change is not significant, however to get your weather app working you will now need to do the following:

1) Follow the instructions here: http://openweathermap.org/appid to sign up, and retrieve your API key.

2) When using the code in the next lectures we use this URL to get weather data:

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily

all you need to do is change this URL to:

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?APPID=YOURAPIKEY

but put the API Key you get from openweathermap in place of the phrase 'YOURAPIKEY'.
